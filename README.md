#### If you have more than 1 url and no time to wait use the -f or --file argument to specify the absolute path to txt file with urls pasted line by line
```sh
$ python download_reloaded.py -f /home/monu/Desktop/urls.txt
```

#### Choose output folder path with the -o or --outFolder argument (The output path must be absolute path and not relative)
